# NorSumm: A Dataset of Human-authored Summaries of Norwegian News Articles

This repository contains the Norwegian Summarisation Benchmark Dataset, which consists of 378 human-authored summaries from prominent Norwegian news sources across various domains. The dataset is designed to benchmark the abstractive summarisation capabilities of generative language models. Each news article within the dataset is accompanied by three distinct gold-standard summaries, authored by native Norwegian speakers. These summaries are available in both written variants of Norwegian – Bokmål and Nynorsk.

The accompanying paper by [Touileb et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07718) provides a comprehensive account of the data creation process and evaluates the performance of existing open large language models for Norwegian on this dataset. Additionally, it offers insights from a manual human evaluation, comparing human-authored summaries to those generated by models. The findings suggest that the dataset presents a challenging benchmark for assessing the summarisation capabilities of LLMs in Norwegian.

### Data sources

We used a subset of news articles from the Norwegian event extraction dataset EDEN [(Touileb et al., 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.488/), as the source for summarisation. Due to the time-intensive nature of creating summaries, we only created summaries for the development and test splits of EDEN, comprising 30 and 33 news articles, respectively.

### Predictions

In addition to the dataset, we also share the predictions of the models dicussed in the paper [(Touileb er al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07718). The [predictions](./predictions/predictions.tsv) for the development set are in the form of a dataframe, which contains:
* ```model```: name of a generative LM (```LumiOpen/Viking-13B```, ```norallm/normistral-7b-warm```, ```norallm/norbloom-7b-scratch```).
* ```prompt```: the best prompt across six prompts used for evaluation. it is selected by maximizing the BERTScore between the model output and the gold standard.
* ```article```: the input text. differs from the data in this [folder](./Data/) in that the trailing whitespaces around "\n\n" are removed (e.g., " \n\n" becomes "\n\n").
* ```summaries```: the human-written summaries.
* ```predictions```: the model output. generated via grid search. NB: can be empty, so remove this when sampling the data for human evaluation.

We also present preliminary modeling results using a graph-based event parser. The resulting dataset will be freely available for download and use."
